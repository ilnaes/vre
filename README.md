# vre

vre is a grep-like tool with a terminal UI that will visually highlight your regular expression matches as you type. There is nothing tricky behind the scenes. vre is literally using Go's `regexp` package to do the matching.

For now, input for vre has to be piped in and matches will be printed out. For example, to get the first five matches from `infile`, use the command

```sh
vre < infile | head -n 5
```
