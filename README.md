# vre

vre is a grep-like tool with a terminal UI that will visually highlight your regular expression matches as you type. There is nothing tricky behind the scenes. vre is just using Go's `regexp` package to do the matching.

## Usage

One can either pipe in the data to be matched or feed in the files via command line arguments. For example, to run vre on all go files in the `internal` directory, use the command

```sh
vre internal/*.go
```

To print the first five matches from `ls`, use the command

```sh
ls | vre | head -n 5
```

To navigate:

- `CTRL-J` Down
- `CTRL-K` Up
- `CTRL-F` Page down
- `CTRL-B` Page up
- `CTRL-T` Toggle showing unmatched lines
- `ENTER` Quit and output matches
- `CTRL-C`/`CTRL-D` Quit without outputting
